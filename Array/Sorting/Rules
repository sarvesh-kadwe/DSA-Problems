Does the problem mention "array needs to be sorted first"? → Sorting.

Do I need to find min/max difference between elements? → Sorting.

Am I merging or comparing intervals/ranges? → Sorting.

Do I need to use Binary Search? → Sorting.

Am I grouping similar elements together (duplicates, anagrams, etc.)? → Sorting.

Do I need to enable efficient two-pointer traversal? → Sorting.

Does a greedy strategy depend on earliest/latest/shortest values? → Sorting.

Do I need adjacent element relationships (like consecutive, closest, gap)? → Sorting.
